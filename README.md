# Tic Tac Toe GUI
**An example brain game developed in Python.**
<br>
In this game, we are dealing with "X" and "O" signs, player number 1 uses the "X" sign and player number 2 (the system) uses the "O" sign.
Two players must try to place their marks in a row.
This is a basic example and the random library is used to game the system so it is very easy for humans to win over the system.

## How Use

Open CMD and run commend : 
```
python main.py
```
